          WHAT IS VR? THE POTENTIAL OF IMPLEMENTING VIRTUAL REALITY IN BUSINESS
          </h2>

          <p><blockquote cite="https://www.linezero.com/blog/virtual-reality-in-business">
          Virtual reality is a computer technology that places users in a three-dimensional digital environment that allows them to interact instead of staring at a screen. The immersive VR experience is the biggest thing that sets it apart from traditional user interfaces. <br><br> 

          Be it entertainment, education, or e-commerce, VR is a growing force behind many evolving industries. However, implementing virtual reality in the workplace is transforming and redefining the way we do things. VR technology recently hit the mainstream with the arrival of affordable and accessible business VR headsets. The technology has helped business industries like healthcare, retail, and education to efficiently deliver services and enhance their virtual reality customer experience. <br><br>
          
          However, it is the corporate world that is expecting the biggest transformation due to the benefits of virtual reality technologies. While the mainstream use of virtual reality is still a little far off, many organizations are already tapping into its enormous potential.</blockquote></p>

            WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS SEEN SO FAR OF IMPLEMENTING VR IN BUSINESSES?
          </h2>
          <hr>

            <blockquote cite="https://www.linezero.com/blog/virtual-reality-in-business">
              Virtual reality (VR) is a game-changer for businesses, providing many benefits such as improving marketing, collaboration, and education.
              <br><br>
              VR creates an engaging work environment that increases employee productivity and can also provide a safe and controlled setting for training and experimentation. This helps decision-makers to make more informed choices and understand the impact of their decisions before making a final call.
              <br><br>
              One of the biggest benefits of VR is enhanced training. Employees can practice and learn in a realistic, immersive environment that helps improve their skills and knowledge while reducing risk. This technology can also increase safety by training employees in high-risk or dangerous situations, reducing the risk of harm.
